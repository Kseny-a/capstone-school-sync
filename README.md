Project Description 

SchoolSync is a web platform designed to help parents of school-aged children connect with one another, stay informed about events, and collaborate as a community. By offering event management and real-time chat features, SchoolSync aims to foster stronger connections and engagement among parents who share a grade level or local community.

Problem Statement

Parents often struggle to network and collaborate with others in their child's grade. This disconnect can lead to missed opportunities for event coordination, community support, and quick resource sharing. SchoolSync addresses this by providing:


1. A user-friendly platform for creating and viewing events.
2. Real-time chat capabilities for sharing information.
3. A secure, centralized environment to manage community interactions.

Target Audience

  Parents/guardians of school-aged children.
  Users interested in planning and attending events, sharing resources, and discussing questions with local parent groups.

MVP Feature Set

Event Page

  - Create Events: Parents can post new events (e.g., field trips, parent gatherings).
 -  View Events: A list of upcoming events with basic details (date, time, location).
  - RSVP Feature: Users can respond if they plan to attend, and see who else has RSVP’d.

Chat Feature

    - Real-Time Group Chat: A chat room designated for parents in the same grade or school.
    - Send/Receive Messages: Enables easy Q&A, announcements, and community discussions.
    - Timestamps: Messages show the date and time posted.

Potential Additional Features

1. Private Messaging: One-on-one chats for more confidential discussions.
2. User Authentication
    1. Login/Sign-up: Users can create new accounts or log in using a valid email and password. 
    2. User Profiles (basic): Store basic information about each parent (name, child’s grade level, etc.).
3. Calendar Integration: Sync event details with Google Calendar or other calendar services.
