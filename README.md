## Project Description 

SchoolSync is a web platform designed to help connect the parents of children who attend the same school and/or same grade. Our app helps parents stay informed about events, collaborate and build community. With features like event management and real-time chat, SchoolSync aims to foster stronger connections and engagement among parents throughout the school year. 

## Problem Statement

Parents often find it challenging to connect and collaborate with others in their child's grade. This disconnect can lead to missed opportunities for coordinating events, community support, and sharing resources. SchoolSync addresses this by providing:

1. A user-friendly platform for creating and viewing events.
2. Real-time chat capabilities for sharing information.
3. A centralized environment to manage community interactions.

## Target Audience

  Parents/guardians of school-aged children.

## MVP Feature Set

### Event Page
- Create Events: Parents can post new events (e.g. playdates at a park, parent gatherings).
- View Events: A list of upcoming events which includes event information (e.g. date, time, location).
- RSVP Feature: Users can respond if they plan to attend and see who else has RSVP’d.

### Chat Feature
- Real-Time Group Chat: A chat room designated for parents in the same grade or school.
- Send/Receive Messages: Enables easy Q&A, announcements, and community discussions.
- Timestamps: Messages show the date and time posted.

## Potential Additional Features
1. Private Messaging: One-on-one chats for more confidential discussions.
2. User Authentication
   - Login/Sign-up: Users can create new accounts or log in using a valid email and password. 
   - User Profiles (basic): Store basic information about each parent (name, child’s grade level, etc.).
3. Calendar Integration: Sync event details with Google Calendar or other calendar services.
